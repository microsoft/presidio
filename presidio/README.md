**Context aware, pluggable and customizable PII de-identification service for text and images.**

## Overview

`presidio` is a convenience meta-package that references and installs
[presidio-analyzer](https://pypi.org/project/presidio-analyzer/) and
[presidio-anonymizer](https://pypi.org/project/presidio-anonymizer/), the PII detection and
anonymization engines from the [Microsoft Presidio](https://github.com/Microsoft/presidio) project.

> **Note:** This package contains no code of its own. It simply pulls in `presidio-analyzer` and
> `presidio-anonymizer` as dependencies. For the full feature set, documentation, and source code
> please refer to the
> [presidio-analyzer README](https://github.com/microsoft/presidio/blob/main/presidio-analyzer/README.md)
> and the
> [presidio-anonymizer README](https://github.com/microsoft/presidio/blob/main/presidio-anonymizer/README.md).
