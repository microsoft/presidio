## SDK Architecture

* The Azure Storage SDK for Go provides low-level and high-level APIs.
	* ServiceURL, ContainerURL and BlobURL objects provide the low-level API functionality and map one-to-one to the [Azure Storage Blob REST APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/blob-service-rest-api)
	* The high-level APIs provide convenience abstractions such as uploading a large stream to a block blob (using multiple PutBlock requests).
