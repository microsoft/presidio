presidio is now installed!

To find out about your newly configured system, run:

  $ helm status {{ .Release.Name }}

To test your new Presidio service, forward the ports: the Analyzer publishes a service at port 8080. To use the Analyzer, you first need to forward this port to your local IP address:

  $ kubectl port-forward -n presidio $(kubectl get pod -n presidio -l app=demo-presidio-analyzer -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 8080:8080
