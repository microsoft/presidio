# Presidio - Data Protection and Anonymization API

**Context aware, pluggable and customizable PII anonymization service for text and images.**

---

## DEPRECATED: 
- This is the V1 version of Presidio. For the most recent version, go to [the `main` branch](https://github.com/microsoft/presidio/tree/main).
- Note that support for services in this version is ceased . 
- The services in this version are still available to download:
  - PyPI: `pip install presidio-analyzer==0.95`
  - Docker: `tag=v1`

- For information on migrating from V1 to V2, [See this documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/presidio_V2.html).

## What is Presidio

Presidio _(Origin from Latin praesidium ‘protection, garrison’)_ helps to ensure sensitive text is properly managed and governed. It provides fast **_analytics_** and **_anonymization_** for sensitive text such as credit card numbers, names, locations, social security numbers, bitcoin wallets, US phone numbers and financial data.
Presidio analyzes the text using predefined or custom recognizers to identify entities, patterns, formats, and checksums with relevant context. Presidio leverages docker and kubernetes for workloads at scale.

Presidio can be integrated into any data pipeline for intelligent PII scrubbing. It is open-source, transparent and scalable. Additionally, PII anonymization use-cases often require a different set of PII entities to be detected, some of which are domain or business specific. Presidio allows you to **customize or add new PII recognizers** via API or code to best fit your anonymization needs.

:warning: Presidio can help identify sensitive/PII data in un/structured text. However, because Presidio is using trained ML models, there is no guarantee that Presidio will find all sensitive information. Consequently, additional systems and protections should be employed.

## :exclamation: Presidio V2 is coming!

In the next few weeks, we will start migrating the Presidio repo from the current version to a new version.

The main changes from V1 to V2 are:
	
- Replacing gRPC with HTTP to allow more customizable APIs and easier debugging.
- The anonymizer service will be Python based and pip installable.
- Focus on the analyzer and anonymizer service. Other services will be deprecated at first and potentially migrated over time to V2 with the help of the community.
- Better documentation, samples and build flows.


Notes:

- The current V1 code base will continue to be available but will no longer be officially supported.
- We will maintain backward compatibility with the current Presidio API for text analysis and anonymization.

We are certain this change will make Presidio much more accessible, maintainable and customizable and we look forward to collaborating with this great community!

Stay tuned!
