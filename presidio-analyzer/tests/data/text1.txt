Welcome to the Data Loss Prevention Demo.

Type or paste some text here to test the DLP API. Findings appear below.

For example, strings like this one produce a PHONE_NUMBER finding:
    "Please call me. My phone number is (555) 253-0000."

Customizing:
To choose classification categories, click "Info types" on the right.

Certainty:
Findings are ranked on a certainty scale of 0 (least certain) to 1 (most
certain). The raw certainty number is provided for each finding:
    Low (0.0 to 0.499)
    Medium (0.5 to 0.799)
    High (0.8 to 1)

Low scores may introduce noise in the results, especially when a particular
string matches multiple detectors. To limit the findings to high scores,
select "High certainty" on the right.
