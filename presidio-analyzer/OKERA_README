To build:
  python3 setup.py bdist_wheel

This creates a wheel file in dist/
  [sudo] pip3 install <path to wheel file>

To install locally.

This can be used to our s3 dev bucket to be assembled to our docker container.
For example:

  aws s3 cp <path to sheel file> s3://cerebrodata-dev/presidio_analyzer-0.0.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl --acl public-read
