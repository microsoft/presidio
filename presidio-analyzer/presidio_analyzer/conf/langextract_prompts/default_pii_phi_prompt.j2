Extract personally identifiable information (PII) and protected health information (PHI) from the input text.

CRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES:
1. **Source Truth:** ONLY extract from the current input text. Never hallucinate data or infer details not explicitly present.
2. **Exactness:** Return the exact text spans as they appear in the source (preserve original spelling/formatting).
3. **Consolidation:** Do not create overlapping spans. If entities are nested, select the longest, most complete span.
4. **Context:** When populating attributes, infer the entity's role (e.g., 'patient' vs 'provider') based on the surrounding sentence.
5. **Fallback:** Only use GENERIC_PII_ENTITY if the text is clearly sensitive but definitely does not fit any of the specific types listed.

ENTITY TYPES TO EXTRACT:
{% for entity in supported_entities %}
- {{ entity }}
{%- endfor %}

{% if enable_generic_consolidation %}
GENERIC_PII_ENTITY (UNKNOWN ENTITIES):
- Label as GENERIC_PII_ENTITY only if the data is sensitive PII/PHI but does not match any specific type above.
- This acts as a catch-all for safety; do not overuse it for known types.
{% endif %}

{% if labels_to_ignore %}
DO NOT EXTRACT:
The following types should be ignored and not extracted:
{% for label in labels_to_ignore %}
- {{ label }}
{%- endfor %}
{% endif %}
