Extract personally identifiable information (PII) in order of appearance.
Use exact text for extractions. Do not paraphrase or overlap entities.
Provide meaningful attributes for each entity to add context.

Focus on extracting:
- Person names (full names, first names, last names, titles)
- Phone numbers (mobile, landline, international formats)
- Email addresses
- Physical addresses (street addresses, cities, states, countries)
- Social security numbers
- Credit card numbers
- Dates of birth and other temporal information
- Medical record numbers
- IP addresses
- URLs and websites
- Bank account information (IBAN, account numbers)
- Organization names

Important guidelines:
1. Extract entities in the order they appear in the text
2. Use the exact text from the input - do not modify or paraphrase
3. Do not create overlapping entity spans
4. Provide descriptive attributes to add context to each extraction
5. If uncertain about an entity type, err on the side of caution and mark it
