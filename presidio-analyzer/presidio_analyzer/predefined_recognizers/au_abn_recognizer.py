    Recognizes Australian Business Number ("ABN").

    The Australian Business Number (ABN) is a unique 11
    digit identifier issued to all entities registered in
    the Australian Business Register (ABR).
    The 11 digit ABN is structured as a 9 digit identifier
    with two leading check digits.
    The leading check digits are derived using a modulus 89 calculation.
    This recognizer identifies ABN using regex, context words and checksum.
