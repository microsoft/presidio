# An Identity Card is a personal recognition document that is valid in Italy.
# The paper-based identity card was issued for nearly 87 years until 2018
# and can still be issued in case of emergency. The Electronic Identity Card
# (CIE) is progressively replacing the paper-based identity card. It is
# issued upon expiration of the paper-based identity card or in case of loss,
# theft or deterioration.
