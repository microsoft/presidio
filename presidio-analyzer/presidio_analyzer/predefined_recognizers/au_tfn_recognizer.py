    Recognizes Australian Tax File Numbers ("TFN").

    The tax file number (TFN) is a unique identifier
    issued by the Australian Taxation Office
    to each taxpaying entity â€” an individual, company,
    superannuation fund, partnership, or trust.
    The TFN consists of a nine digit number, usually
    presented in the format NNN NNN NNN.
    TFN includes a check digit for detecting erroneous
    number based on simple modulo 11.
    This recognizer uses regex, context words,
    and checksum to identify TFN.
