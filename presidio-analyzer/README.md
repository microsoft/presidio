# Presidio analyzer

## Description

The Presidio analyzer is a Python based service for detecting PII entities in text.

During analysis, it runs a set of different _PII Recognizers_,
each one in charge of detecting one or more PII entities using different mechanisms.

Presidio analyzer comes with a set of predefined recognizers,
but can easily be extended with other types of custom recognizers.
Predefined and custom recognizers leverage regex,
Named Entity Recognition and other types of logic to detect PII in unstructured text.
