# List from https://ntsi.com/drivers-license-format/
# ---------------

# WA Driver License number is relatively unique as it also
# includes '*' chars.
# However it can also be 12 letters which makes every 12 letter'
# word a match. Therefore we split WA driver license
# regex: r'\b([A-Z][A-Z0-9*]{11})\b' into two regexes
# With different weights, one to indicate letters only and
# one to indicate at least one digit or one '*'

# pylint: disable=line-too-long,abstract-method
STRONG_REGEX = r'(\(\d{3}\)\s*\d{3}[-\.\s]??\d{4}|d{3}[-\.\s]\d{3}[-\.\s]\d{4})'  # noqa: E501
MEDIUM_REGEX = r'\b(\d{3}[-\.\s]\d{3}[-\.\s]??\d{4})\b'
WEAK_REGEX = r'(\b\d{10}\b)'
