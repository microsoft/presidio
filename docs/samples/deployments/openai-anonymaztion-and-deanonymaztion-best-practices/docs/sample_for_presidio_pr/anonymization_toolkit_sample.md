# Anonymization Toolkit Sample

This sample introduces a toolkit designed to: 

- Anonymize sensitive data before sending it to large language models (LLMs)
- De-anonymize the received data while maintaining confidentiality.

The toolkit is particularly useful in "Chat with your data" scenarios within enterprises, ensuring that personally identifiable information (PII) present in corporate documents is not exposed to users during queries.

The following sections will describe the required infrastructure and code to achieve the above functionality.

## Target Audience

The toolkit serves enterprises that: Require PII to remain internal while leveraging external OpenAI APIs, and Aim to safeguard PII from being displayed post-OpenAI processing.

## Workflow Example

The following is the desired output. We can input PII data annoymized to the LLM input and return the replaced entities back to the original in the response back to the user.

- User Input: "Hello world, my name is Jane Doe. My number is: 034453334"
- Anonymized LLM Input: "Hello world, my name is [PERSON]. My number is: [PHONE_NUMBER]"
- LLM Response: "Hey [PERSON], nice to meet you!"
- De-anonymized User Response: "Hey Jane Doe, nice to meet you!"

## Infrastructure

The solution consists of the following components:

- Api
- Client
- Redis

### Anonymization

First we need to setup our `Presidio` engines to aid with analysis, anonoymization and deanonymization.
The following code can exist as part of a service available to the appropriate api endpoints.

```python
        configuration = {
            "nlp_engine_name": "spacy",
            "models": [
                {"lang_code": "en", "model_name": "en_core_web_lg"},
                {"lang_code": "nl", "model_name": "nl_core_news_sm"},
                {"lang_code": "es", "model_name": "es_core_news_sm"},
            ],
        }
        provider = NlpEngineProvider(nlp_configuration=configuration)
        nlp_engine = provider.create_engine()

        self.analyzer = AnalyzerEngine(
            nlp_engine=nlp_engine,
            supported_languages=["en", "nl", "es"]
        )
        self.anonymizer = AnonymizerEngine()
        self.anonymizer.add_anonymizer(InstanceCounterAnonymizer)
        self.deanonymizer = DeanonymizeEngine()
        self.deanonymizer.add_deanonymizer(InstanceCounterDeanonymizer)
```

`InstanceCounterAnonymizer` and `InstanceCounterDeanonymizer` taken from [these examples](https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/samples/python/pseudonomyzation/).

We anonymize data with the following:

```python
    def anonymize_text(self, session_id: str, text: str, language: str, entity_mappings: dict) -> Tuple[str, List[OperatorResult], dict] :
        """ Anonymize the given text using Presidio Analyzer and Anonymizer engines """

        logger.info(f"Anonymize text called with session_id: {session_id}")
        start_time = timer()

        try:
            results = self.analyzer.analyze(text=text, language=language)
            logger.info(f"Analyze took {timer() - start_time:.3f} seconds for session_id: {session_id}")

            anonymizer_start_time = timer()
            anonymizer_entity_mapping = entity_mappings.copy() if entity_mappings is not None else dict()
            anonymized_result = self.anonymizer.anonymize(
                text=text,
                analyzer_results=results,
                operators={
                    "DEFAULT": OperatorConfig(
                        "entity_counter", {"entity_mapping": anonymizer_entity_mapping}
                    )
                },
            )
            logger.info(f"Anonymize took {timer() - anonymizer_start_time:.3f} seconds for session_id: {session_id}")

            total_time = timer() - start_time
            logger.info(f"Total processing time: {total_time:.3f} seconds for session_id: {session_id}")

            return anonymized_result.text, anonymizer_entity_mapping
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception(f"Error in anonymize_text for session_id {session_id}")
            raise
```

and deanonymize with:

```python
    def deanonymize_text(self, session_id: str, text: str, entity_mappings: dict) -> str:
        """ Deanonymize the given text using Presidio Analyzer and Anonymizer engines """

        logger.info(f"Deanonymize text called with session_id: {session_id}")
        start_time = timer()

        try:
            entities = self.get_entities(entity_mappings, text)

            deanonymized = self.deanonymizer.deanonymize(
                text=text,
                entities=entities,
                operators=
                {"DEFAULT": OperatorConfig("entity_counter_deanonymizer", 
                                        params={"entity_mapping": entity_mappings})}
            )

            total_time = timer() - start_time
            logger.info(f"Total processing time: {total_time:.3f} seconds for session_id: {session_id}")
            
            return deanonymized.text
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception(f"Error in deanonymize_text for session_id {session_id}")
            raise

    def get_entities(self, entity_mappings: dict, text: str) -> List[OperatorResult]:
        """ Get the entities from the entity mappings """

        entities = []
        for entity_type, entity_mapping in entity_mappings.items():
            for entity_value, entity_id in entity_mapping.items():
                start_index = 0
                while True:
                    start_index = text.find(entity_id, start_index)
                    if start_index == -1:
                        break
                    end_index = start_index + len(entity_id)
                    entities.append(OperatorResult(start_index, end_index, entity_type, entity_value, entity_id))
                    start_index += len(entity_id)
        return entities
```

The above code would be called with:

```python
    # anonymize example
    anonymized_text, new_entity_mappings = presidio_service.anonymize_text(
            request.session_id, request.text, request.language, entity_mappings
        )

    # deanonymize example
    deanonymized_text = presidio_service.deanonymize_text(
            request.session_id, request.text, entity_mappings
        )
```

Where:

- `request.session_id`
  - A unique session identifier, e.g. guid.
- `request.text`
  - The text to be anonymized or deanonymized.
- `request.language`
  - The language code to analyze with. Note this requires the appropriate language model to be setup during the configuration. See code above. Example codes, `en`, `es`, `nl`.
- `entity_mappings`
  - A dictionary with the structure of:

    ```python
        {'LOCATION': {'Redmond': '<LOCATION_0>'}, 'PERSON': {'Joe Bloggs': '<PERSON_0>'}}
    ```

  - Each item is the entity type and the value contains each instance of the entity and its replacement.
  - This dictionary is optional. On the first request of a session we wont have any mappings, subsequent requests can then build upon this dictionary to maintain knowledge of previous request mappings.
