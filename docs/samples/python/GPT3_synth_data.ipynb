                "This notebook demonstrates how to leverage OpenAI models for fake/surrogate data generation. It uses Presidio to first de-identify data (as de-identification might be required prior to passing the model to OpenAI), and then uses OpenAI completion models to create synthetic/fake/surrogate data based on real data. OpenAI models would also potentially remove additional PII entities, if those are not detected by Presidio.\n",
