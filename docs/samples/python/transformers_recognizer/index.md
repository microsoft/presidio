# Run Presidio With Transformers Models

This example demonstrates how to extract PII entities using transformers models.
When initializing the `TransformersRecognizer`, choose from the following options:
1. A string referencing an uploaded model to HuggingFace. Use this url to access all TokenClassification models - https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=token-classification&sort=downloads

2. Initialize your own TokenClassificationPipeline instance using your custom transformers model and use it for inference.

3. Provide the path to your own local custom trained model.

!!! note "Note"
For each combination of model & dataset, it is recommended to create a configuration object which includes setting necessary parameters for getting the correct results. Please reference this [configuraion.py](configuration.py) file for examples.


### Example Code


```python
from configuration import BERT_DEID_CONFIGURATION
from presidio_analyzer import AnalyzerEngine, RecognizerRegistry
from transformers_recognizer import TransformersRecognizer

model_path = "obi/deid_roberta_i2b2"

supported_entities = ["PERSON", "DATE_TIME", "LOCATION"]
transformers_recognizer = TransformersRecognizer(model_path=model_path, supported_entities=supported_entities)

# This would download a large (~500Mb) model on the first run
transformers_recognizer.load_transformer(**BERT_DEID_CONFIGURATION)

# Add transformers model to the registry
registry = RecognizerRegistry()
registry.add_recognizer(transformers_recognizer)
analyzer = AnalyzerEngine(registry=registry)

sample = "My name is John and I live in NY"
results = analyzer.analyze(sample, language="en",
                            return_decision_process=True,
                            )
print("Found the following entities:")
for result in results:
    print(result, '----', sample[result.start:result.end])
```
