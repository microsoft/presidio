## Environment Setup for Presidio in Fabric
The spaCy model can be downloaded from here: [English Â· spaCy Models Documentation](https://spacy.io/models/en#en_core_web_lg)

### 1. Requirements
- **Fabric workspace** with sufficient permissions to create and manage custom environments.
- **Lakehouse** access for uploading large models or data files.

### 2. Configure Spark Pool
Make sure to create (or select) a valid Spark pool that you can attach to your Fabric environment.

### 3. Create a New Environment
1. In your Fabric workspace, go to **Settings** and select **New Environment**.
2. Provide a name (e.g., `presidio-env`) and choose the appropriate Python version.
3. Configure any required settings (e.g., pinned versions, advanced options).

### 4. Add Dependencies
1. Under **Public Library**, add the essential libraries:
   - `presidio-analyzer`
   - `presidio-anonymizer`
   - `spacy`

2. For **smaller SpaCy models** (like `en_core_web_md` < 300MB), you can include them directly in this environment.

### 5. Upload a Large SpaCy Model
If you want to use `en_core_web_lg` (which typically exceeds 300MB):
1. Upload the `.whl` file to your Lakehouse (or any location accessible by Spark).
2. You will install it **within the notebook** rather than from this environment.

### 6. Compute
Configure your compute, make sure to use the pool configured before

### 7. Review & Save
- Confirm your chosen libraries appear under the **Custom Library** or **Public Library** tabs.
- Click **Save** to finalize your environment setup.

### 8. Run the Sample Notebook
1. Open the [`presidio_and_spark.ipynb`](./artifacts/presidio_and_spark.ipynb) notebook.
2. When opening your notebook, ensure you pick the **custom environment** you created.
3. Confirm you have selected the valid **Spark pool** you configured earlier.

4. Within the notebook, if you're using a large SpaCy model, install it using:
   ```python
   # Please update the path to your model path.
   %pip install /lakehouse/default/Files/presidio/models/en_core_web_lg-3.8.0-py3-none-any.whl
