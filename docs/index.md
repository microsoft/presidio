# **Presidio**: Data Protection and Anonymization SDK

Presidio _(Origin from Latin praesidium ‘protection, garrison’)_
helps to ensure sensitive data is properly managed and governed.
It provides fast **_identification_** and **_anonymization_**
modules for private entities in text and images such as
credit card numbers, names, locations, social security numbers,
bitcoin wallets, US phone numbers, financial data and more.

## Goals

- Allow organizations to preserve privacy in a simpler way by democratizing de-identification technologies and introducing transparency in decisions.
- Embrace extensibility and customizability to a specific business need.
- Facilitate both fully automated and semi-automated PII de-identification flows on multiple platforms.

## How it works

![Presidio demo gif](assets/detection_flow.gif)

## Main features

1. **Predefined** or **custom PII recognizers** leveraging *Named Entity Recognition*, *regular expressions*, *rule based logic* and *checksum* with relevant context in multiple languages.
2. Options for connecting to external PII detection models.
3. Multiple usage options, **from Python or PySpark workloads through Docker to Kubernetes**.
4. **Customizability** in PII identification and anonymization.
5. Module for **redacting PII text in images**.

!!! warning "Warning"
    Presidio can help identify sensitive/PII data in un/structured text. However, because Presidio is using trained ML models, there is no guarantee that Presidio will find all sensitive information. Consequently, additional systems and protections should be employed.
