Presidio _(Origin from Latin praesidium ‘protection, garrison’)_
helps to ensure sensitive data is properly managed and governed.
It provides fast **_identification_** and **_anonymization_**
modules for private entities in text and images such as
credit card numbers, names, locations, social security numbers,
bitcoin wallets, US phone numbers, financial data and more.


!!! info "Project transition update"
    Presidio is transitioning to a community-owned project.
    Read the full announcement [here](project_transition.md).


## Goals

- Allow organizations to preserve privacy in a simpler way by democratizing de-identification technologies and introducing transparency in decisions.
- Embrace extensibility and customizability to a specific business need.
- Facilitate both fully automated and semi-automated PII de-identification flows on multiple platforms.

## How it works

![Presidio demo gif](assets/detection_flow.gif)

## Main features

1. **Predefined** or **custom PII recognizers** leveraging _Named Entity Recognition_, _regular expressions_, _rule based logic_ and _checksum_ with relevant context in multiple languages.
2. Options for connecting to external PII detection models.
3. Multiple usage options, **from Python or PySpark workloads through Docker to Kubernetes**.
4. **Customizability** in PII identification and anonymization.
5. Module for **redacting PII text in images**.

!!! warning "Warning"
    Presidio can help identify sensitive/PII data in un/structured text. However, because it is using automated detection mechanisms, there is no guarantee that Presidio will find all sensitive information. Consequently, additional systems and protections should be employed.
