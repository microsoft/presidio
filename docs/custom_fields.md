# Custom fields

Presidio supports custom fields using either online via a simple REST API or by adding new PII recognizers in code. The underlying object behind each field is called a 'Recognizer'. This documentation describes how to add new recognizers by API or code.

1. API

    a. Getting a recoginzer

    ```sh
    GET <api-service-address>/api/v1/analyzer/recognizers/<recognizer_name>
    ```

    b. Getting all recognizers

    ```sh
    GET <api-service-address>/api/v1/analyzer/recognizers
    ```

    c. Creating a new recoginzer

    ```sh
    POST <api-service-address>/api/v1/analyzer/recognizers/<new_recognizer_name>
    ```

    ### Request structure:

    #### Example json:

    ```json
    {
        "value": {
            "entity": "ROCKET",
            "language": "en",
            "patterns": [
                {
                    "name": "rocket-recognizer",
                    "regex": "\\W*(rocket)\\W*",
                    "score": 1
                },
                {
                    "name": "projectile-recognizer",
                    "regex": "\\W*(projectile)\\W*",
                    "score": 1
                }
            ]
        }
    }
    ```

    #### Description:

    | Field          | Description                                                       | Optional   |
    | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
    | `value` | The recognizer json object                         | no        |

    Recognizer format:

    | Field          | Description                                                       | Optional   |
    | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
    | `entity` | The name of the new field. e.g. 'ROCKET'                         | no        |
    | `language` | The supported language                         | no        |
    | `patterns` | A list of regular expressions objects                         | yes        |
    | `blacklist` | A list of words to be identified as PII entities e.g. ["Mr","Mrs","Ms","Miss"]                         | yes        |
    | `contextPhrases` | A list of words to be used for improving confidence, in case they are found in vicinity to an identified entity e.g. ["credit-card","credit","cc","amex"]                         | yes        |

    A request should provide either `patterns` or `blacklist` as input.


    Regular expression format:

    | Field          | Description                                                       | Optional   |
    | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
    | `name` | The name of this pattern                         | no        |
    | `regex` | A regular expression                         | no        |
    | `score` | The score given to entities detected by this recognizer                         | no        |

    d. Update a recoginzer

    ```sh
    PUT <api-service-address>/api/v1/analyzer/recognizers/<recognizer_name>
    ```

    Payload is similar to the one described in  `Creating new recognizer`.

    e.  Delete a recoginzer

    ```sh
    DELETE <api-service-address>/api/v1/analyzer/recognizers/<recognizer_name>
    ```

    f. Using the custom field

    After creating a new recognizer, either explicitly state in the templates the newly added entity name, or set allFields to true. For example:

    i. `allFields=True`:

    ```sh
    echo -n '{"text":"They sent a rocket to the moon!", "analyzeTemplate":{"allFields":true}  }' | http <api-service-address>/api/v1/projects/<my-project>/analyze
    ```

    ii. Specifically define the recognizers to be used:

    ```sh
    echo -n '{"text":"They sent a rocket to the moon!", "analyzeTemplate":{"fields":[{"name": "ROCKET"}]}}' | http <api-service-address>/api/v1/projects/<my-project>/analyze    
    ```

2. Custom recognizer by code

    Code based recognizers are written in Python and are a part of the [presidio-analyzer](../presidio-analyzer) module. The main modules in `presidio-analyzer` are the `AnalyzerEngine` and the `RecognizerRegistry`. The `AnalyzerEngine` is in charge of calling each requested recognizer. the `RecognizerRegistry` is in charge of providing the list of predefined and custom recognizers for analysis.

    In order to implement a new recognizer by code, follow these two steps:

    a. Implement the abstract recognizer class:

    Create a new Python class which implements [LocalRecognizer](../presidio-analyzer/analyzer/local_recognizer.py). `LocalRecognizer` implements the base [EntityRecognizer](../presidio-analyzer/analyzer/entity_recognizer.py) class. All local recognizers run locally together with all other predefined recognizers as a part of the `presidio-analyzer` Python process. In contrast, `RemoteRecognizer` is a placeholder for recognizers that are external to the `presidio-analyzer` service, for example on a different microservice.

    The `EntityRecognizer` abstract class requires the implementation the following methods:

    i. initializing a model. Occurs when the `presidio-analyzer` process starts:

    ```python
    def load(self)
    ```

    ii. analyze: The main function to be called for getting entities out of the new recognizer:

    ```python
    def analyze(self, text, entities, nlp_artifacts):
    ```

    The `analyze` method should return a list of [RecognizerResult](../presidio-analyzer/analyzer/recognizer_result.py). Refer to the [code documentation](../presidio-analyzer/analyzer/entity_recognizer.py) for more information.

    b. Reference and add the new class to the `RecognizerRegistry` module, in the `load_predefined_recognizers` method, which registers all code based recognizers.
