# Customizing recognizer registry from file
To load recognizers from file, use `RecognizerRegistryProvider` to instantiate the recognizer registry and then pass it through to the analyzer engine:

```python
from presidio_analyzer import AnalyzerEngine
from presidio_analyzer.recognizer_registry import RecognizerRegistryProvider

recognizer_registry_conf_file = "./analyzer/recognizers-config.yml"

provider = RecognizerRegistryProvider(
                conf_file=recognizer_registry_conf_file
            )
registry = provider.create_recognizer_registry()
analyzer = AnalyzerEngine(registry=registry)

results = analyzer.analyze(text="My name is Morris", language="en")
print(results)
```

## Configuration file structure

```yaml
global_regex_flags: 26

supported_languages: 
  - en

recognizers: 
...
```

The configuration file consists of two parts:

  - `global_regex_flags`: regex flags to be used in regex matching (see [regex flags](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#flags)).
  - `supported_languages`: A list of supported languages that the registry will support.
  - `recognizers`: a list of recognizers to be loaded by the recognizer registry. This list consists of two different types of recognizers: 
    - Predefined: A set of already defined recognizer classes in presidio. This includes all recognizers defined in the codebase (along with user defined recognizers) that inherit from EntityRecognizer.
    - Custom: custom created pattern recognizers that are created based on the fields provided in the configuration file.

!!! note "Note"

    supported_languages must be identical to the same field in analyzer_engine

## Recognizer list

The recognizer list comprises of both the predefined and custom recognizers, for example: 

```yaml
...
  - name: CreditCardRecognizer
    supported_languages:
    - language: en
      context: [credit, card, visa, mastercard, cc, amex, discover, jcb, diners, maestro, instapayment]
    - language: es
      context: [tarjeta, credito, visa, mastercard, cc, amex, discover, jcb, diners, maestro, instapayment]
    - language: it
    - language: pl
    type: predefined

  - name: UsBankRecognizer
    supported_languages: 
    - en
    type: predefined

  - name: MedicalLicenseRecognizer
    type: predefined

  - name: ExampleCustomRecognizer
    patterns:
    - name: "zip code (weak)"
      regex: "(\\b\\d{5}(?:\\-\\d{4})?\\b)"
      score: 0.01
    - name: "zip code (weak)"
      regex: "(\\b\\d{5}(?:\\-\\d{4})?\\b)"
      score: 0.01
    supported_languages:
    - language: en
      context: [zip, code]
    - language: es
      context: [c√≥digo, postal]
    supported_entity: "ZIP"
    type: custom
    enabled: true

  - name: "TitlesRecognizer"
    supported_language: "en"
    supported_entity: "TITLE"
    deny_list: [Mr., Mrs., Ms., Miss, Dr., Prof.]
    deny_list_score: 1
```

### The recognizer parameters

  - `supported_languages`: A list of supported languages that the analyzer will support. In case this field is missing, a recognizer will be created for each supported language provided to the `AnalyzerEngine`. 
  In addition to the language code, this field also contains a list of context words, which increases confidence in the detection in case it is found in the surroundings of a detected entity (as seen in the credit card example above).
  - `type`: this could be either predefined or custom. As this is optional, if not stated otherwise, the default type is custom.
  - `name`: Different per the type of the recognizer. For predefined recognizers, this is the class name as defined in presidio, while for custom recognizers, it will be set as the name of the recognizer.
  - `patterns`: a list of objects of type `Pattern` that contains a name, score and regex that define matching patterns.
  - `enabled`: enables or disables the recognizer.
  - `supported_entity`: the detected entity associated by the recognizer.
  - `deny_list`: A list of words to detect, in case the recognizer uses a predefined list of words.
  - `deny_list_score`: confidence score for a term identified using a deny-list.
