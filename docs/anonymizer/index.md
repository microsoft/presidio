# Presidio Anonymizer

The Presidio anonymizer is a Python based module for anonymizing detected PII text
entities with desired values.

Persidio anonymizer comes with predefined anonymizers but can easily be extended.

## Installation

=== "Using pip"

    !!! note "Note"
        Consider installing the Presidio python packages on a virtual environment like venv or conda.
    
    To get started with Presidio-anonymizer, run:
    
    ```sh
    pip install presidio-anonymizer
    ```

=== "Using Docker"

    !!! note "Note"
        This requires Docker to be installed. [Download Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
    
    ```sh
    # Download image from Dockerhub
    docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/presidio-anonymizer
    
    # Run the container with the default port
    docker run -d -p 5001:5001 mcr.microsoft.com/presidio-anonymizer:latest
    ```

=== "From source"

    First, clone the Presidio repo. [See here for instructions](../installation.md#install-from-source).
    
    Then, build the presidio-anonymizer container:
    
    ```sh
    cd presidio-anonnymizer
    docker build . -t presidio/presidio-anonymizer
    ```

## Getting started

=== "Python"

    Once the Presidio-anonymizer package is installed, run this simple script:
    
    ```python
    from presidio_anonymizer import AnonymizerEngine
    from presidio_anonymizer.entities import AnalyzerResult, AnonymizerConfig
    
    # Initialize the engine with logger.
    engine = AnonymizerEngine()
    
    # Class the anonymize function with the text, analyzer results and
    # Anonymizers config to define the anonymization type.
    result = engine.anonymize(
        text="My name is Bond, James Bond",
        analyzer_results=[AnalyzerResult("PERSON", 11, 15, 0.8),
                          AnalyzerResult("PERSON", 17, 27, 0.8)],
        anonymizers_config={"PERSON": AnonymizerConfig("replace", {"new_value": "BIP"})}
    )
    
    print(result)
    
    ```

=== "As an HTTP server"

    You can run presidio anonymizer as an http server using either python runtime or using a docker container.
    
    #### Using docker container
    
    ```sh
    cd presidio-anonymizer
    docker run -p 5001:5001 presidio-anonymizer 
    ```
    
    #### Using python runtime
    
    !!! note "Note"
        This requires the Presidio Github repository to be cloned.
    
    ```sh
    cd presidio-anonymizer
    python app.py
    
    Anonymize:
    
    curl -XPOST http://localhost:3000/anonymize -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @payload

    payload example:
    {
    "text": "hello world, my name is Jane Doe. My number is: 034453334",
    "anonymizers": {
        "PHONE_NUMBER": {
            "type": "mask",
            "masking_char": "*",
            "chars_to_mask": 4,
            "from_end": true
        }
    },
    "analyzer_results": [
        {
            "start": 24,
            "end": 32,
            "score": 0.8,
            "entity_type": "NAME"
        },
        {
            "start": 24,
            "end": 28,
            "score": 0.8,
            "entity_type": "FIRST_NAME"
        },
        {
            "start": 29,
            "end": 32,
            "score": 0.6,
            "entity_type": "LAST_NAME"
        },
        {
            "start": 48,
            "end": 57,
            "score": 0.95,
            "entity_type": "PHONE_NUMBER"
        }
    ]}
    ```
## Built-in anonymizers:

| Anonymizer type | Description | Parameters
| --- | ---| ---|
| replace | replaces the PII with desired value | `new_value` - replaces existing text with the given value.<br> If `new_value` is not supplied or empty, default behavior will be: <entity_type\> e.g: <PHONE_NUMBER\> |
| redact | removes the PII completely from text | None |
| hash | hash the PII using either sha256, sha512 or md5 | `hash_type` - sets the type of hashing. Can be either `sha256`, `sha512` or `md5`. <br> The default hash type is `sha256`. | 
| mask | replaces the PII with a given character | `chars_to_mask` - the amount of characters out of the PII that should be replaced. <br> `masking_char` - the character to be replaced with. <br> `from_end` - Whether to mask the PII from it's end. |

!!! note "Note"
    If anonymizers map is empty or "DEFAULT" key is not stated, the default
    anonymizer is "replace" for all entities. The replacing value will be the entity type
    e.g.: <PHONE_NUMBER\>


## Overlapping Anonymization Scenarios

As the input text could potentially have overlapping PII entities, there are different
anonymization scenarios:

- No overlap (single PII) - single PII over text entity, uses a given or default
  anonymizer to anonymize and replace the PII text entity.
- Full overlap of PIIs - When one text have several PIIs, the PII with the higher score
  will be taken. Between PIIs with identical scores, the selection will be arbitrary.
- One PII is contained in another - anonymizer will use the PII with larger text.
- Partial intersection - both will be returned concatenated.

Example of how each scenario would work. Our text will be:

My name is Inigo Montoya. You Killed my Father. Prepare to die. BTW my number is:
03-232323.

- No overlaps - only Inigo was recognized as NAME:
  My name is <NAME\> Montoya. You Killed my Father. Prepare to die. BTW my number is:
  03-232323.
- Full overlap - the number was recognized as PHONE_NUMBER with score of 0.7 and as SSN
  with score of 0.6, we will take the higher score:
  My name is Inigo Montoya. You Killed my Father. Prepare to die. BTW my number is:
  <PHONE_NUMBER\>
- One PII is contained is another - Inigo was recognized as FIRST_NAME and Inigo Montoya
  was recognized as NAME, we will take the larger one:
  My name is <NAME\>. You Killed my Father. Prepare to die. BTW my number is: 03-232323.
- Partial intersection - the number 03-2323 is recognized as a PHONE_NUMBER but 232323
  is recognized as SSN:
  My name is Inigo Montoya. You Killed my Father. Prepare to die. BTW my number is:
  <PHONE_NUMBER\><SSN\>.

## Creating new anonymizers

Presidio anonymizer can be easily extended to support additional anonnymization methods.
See [this tutorial on adding new anonymization methods](adding_anonymizers.md)
for more information.
