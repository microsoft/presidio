### Changed
#### Analyzer
* Refactored the `NlpEngine` and Ner recognizers (`SpacyRecognizer`, `TransformersRecognizer`, `StanzaRecognizer`) to allow simpler integration of huggingface and transformers models (#1159). This includes:
    - Changes in how NER results flow through Presidio (see docs)
    - NER/model definition is now defined using a conf file or a `NerModelConfiguration` object.
    - Integrated `spacy-huggingface-pipelines` for a more robust integration of huggingface models.        
* As a result, `SpacyRecognizer` logic has changed, please see #1159. Some fields within the class are now deprecated.
